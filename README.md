# AND Gate Testbench (SystemVerilog)

This is my first GitHub project as I start my journey to become a Design Verification Engineer.  

It contains a simple **SystemVerilog testbench** for an AND gate.  
The testbench applies all possible inputs (00, 01, 10, 11) and prints the output.

## How to Run
You can run this using any SystemVerilog simulator such as:
- Icarus Verilog (`iverilog`)
- ModelSim / Questa
- Synopsys VCS
